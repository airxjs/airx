## Governance Write Rule
- MUST use governance tools for task/roadmap state updates.

- [ ] architecture.md reviewed (designs/core/architecture.md)
- [ ] code-style.md reviewed (designs/core/code-style.md)
- [ ] ui-style.md reviewed (designs/core/ui-style.md)

## Commit Reminder
- When recording changes, include a concise, descriptive commit message and link any related task or roadmap IDs when relevant.
- Suggested formats (follow your project convention):
-  - Conventional Commits: type(scope): short summary (e.g. feat(api): add user endpoint)
-  - Simple imperative: Short imperative sentence (e.g. Add validation for X)
- Add references in the footer when appropriate, e.g. Refs: TASK-123, ROADMAP-456.
- If your project enforces a specific commit policy, follow that policy instead.
